## Introduction

Generally, it is a bit difficult to install Android Studio. So, I've created a script to automate the process!
### Do note that this requires active internet connection and atleast 1.5GB of data
## Step-1
If using **Windows 11**
- Press Windows button and type Terminal.
- Click on that app to open

- Android Studio Will start downloading.
<!-- - After that, double click the downloaded file to start installing
 -->
- Install the downloaded setup file
- Press the Windows button and type Android Studio
- Open the App
- Click "Next" button until you get to a page where it might say "SDK Manager Not Found"
- Then Click "Next" there as well.
- If any licenses are asked, agree to all of them.
- Wait for the packages to download and finish installing. 

## Now you're done with the installation!
