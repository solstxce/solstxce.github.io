## Introduction

Generally, it is a bit difficult to install Android Studio. So, I've created a script to automate the process!
### Do note that this requires active internet connection and atleast 1.5GB of data
## Step-1
#### MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ANDROID STUDIO INSTALLED
- Press Windows button and type Android Studio.
- Click on that app to open

</div>


## Step-2
- Click the link here to download the code from TodoList github repo: [Click Here](https://codeload.github.com/StarkDroid/JetpackTodoSample/zip/refs/heads/master)

<div class="text-center">

</div>

- Right click the downloaded file and click "Extract All" button.
- Once that is done, you will see a folder like this:

</div>


#### Updated it. Kindly re-run the command

## Step-3

- Now, go back to Android Studio again.
- Once that opens, click the open button if you see a screen like this:

<div class="text-center">
  <br/>

</div>

- And then choose the downloaded folder to open it in Android Studio!

<div class="text-center">
  <br/>

</div>

- If it asks for permissions like following:

<div class="text-center">
  <br/>

</div>

- Click the Tick mark next to trust and then click Trust Project

### You have now opened a project successfully!


## Step-3.5
- Instead of the above screen, if you get a screen like this, 

<div class="text-center">
  <br/>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fZMvVT9.png" alt="Perms2" />
</div>

- Click "File" and click "Open". Then choose the extracted folder. 
- There you should be able to see an Android Icon next to the folder
- Click on it and click open. That's all!
